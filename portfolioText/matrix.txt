main | <a href="https://github.com/EricLindesay/matrixCalculator" target="_blank">Repository Link</a><br><br>This is a Python command line tool for matrix maths using argparse and multipledispatch. It was created as a supplement to my learning in the Mathematics for Computer Scientists 2 (MCS2) module.
motivation | In MCS2, we covered matrix maths and manipulation. To help me understand and remember the operations, I created this python program. Additionally, it allowed me to easily create questions for myself and then compare the result to the program's output to see whether I got the question correct or not.<br><br>Another reason I wanted to do this project is (before starting this project) I recently learnt operator overloading in Python so I used this project as an excuse to use and gain familiarity with the functions. 
description | This command line tool allows for 16 commands, based on content that we covered in MCS2. It consists of two main files, matrix.py and matrixLib.py. Matrix.py calls matrixLib.py and is just used for command line arguments and the interpretation of those arguments while matrixLib.py does all of the computation. It also has unit tests using the unittest package which is the first time I used that package and was very useful for confirming the functions were correct.
result | This project does all of the matrix calculations I needed and I haven't had a problem with it returning incorrect results. The main difficulty was in Gaussian elimintation and LU factorisation as I had never covered them in maths previously however I got it working and am very pleased about it. These functions may not be as efficient as they could be, however, I wanted to code it similarly to the process that you would take when solving the matrices on paper so that I could easily translate the issues overcome when coding it into knowledge applicable for the exam, on which I got 82%.
