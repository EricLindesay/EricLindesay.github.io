subtitle | University of Nottingham
main | This was a coursework with the University. We got given a wrapper library around SDL (a C graphical library) and got given free rein over what we did with it. Our only restrictions were that it had to be in C++ and we had some criteria to meet. The program I ended up creating is a game similar to Wii Tanks, a game which I greatly enjoyed during my childhood.
motivation | C++ is a language I enjoy using so I was looking forward to this coursework. It also allowed me to practice writing code efficiently, for example for my collision bitmaps and for the enemy AI.
description | This game consists of 3 levels and can easily be expanded as each level is stored using JSON. The player can move forward and backwards, rotate and shoot bullets which rebound on walls and the enemy can do the same. It was quite difficult to program the enemy shooting. Since the bullets can bounce, to check valid shots which the enemy can do becomes very computationally expensive. It was very fun for me to optimise this so that the enemy is intelligent without lagging the game, leading me to do some interesting vector maths.
result | This coursework didn't meet all of my personal expectations by the time it was due. During this summer, I plan to add more features to the game, improving the enemy AI further and diversifying the types of enemies. Additionally I plan to use libraries to help with development such as a proper JSON parser since, during the coursework, we weren't allowed to use any libraries except the wrapper provided meaning I had to make the current JSON parser myself.
