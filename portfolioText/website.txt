motivation | In my opinion, it is quite professional when you have a website of your own, so I wanted to make one. It also has allowed me to learn and become comfortable with Bootstrap which will be useful for web development in the future.
description | This website uses Bootstrap and consists of two pages, the CV page and the Portfolio page. Additionally, while developing this site, I created a quick Python program to automatically format the Portfolio page. I can give it a templated text file with the project's information and it automatically generates the cards which you can see here. 
result | Well you can see the result of this project for yourself.
