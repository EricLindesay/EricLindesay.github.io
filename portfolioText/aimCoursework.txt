title | MIN-SET-COVER problem AI
subtitle | University of Nottingham
main | This was a piece of coursework as part of second year at the University. We had to develop an AI in Java to solve the MIN-SET-COVER problem. In this problem, you get given a set of resources and you have to use the minimal number of resources to satisfy your needs which, as you can imagine, is a common problem. An example use is "if you are given N programmers who each know a set of programming languages, what are the minimum number of programmers required to cover every programming language?".<br><br>This problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem (COP). This means you cannot solve this problem in polynomial time (it must be exponential time for example) so we need to use AI to solve it within a reasonable time frame, especially as the number of resources get high.
motivation | This was a coursework I was very interested in, AI is fascinating and I was very interested in learning how it works in more detail which was a requirement for the coursework as we had to implement it from scratch.
description | For the coursework, we had to develop a learning hyper-heuristic AI with elaborate move acceptance (I used simulated annealing with reheating using a geometric cooling schedule).<br><br>We had to use Java. This allowed us to form an understanding of how AI works "under-the-hood" without the abstraction which libraries can give you since we weren't allowed to use any libraries.
result | This coursework was very enjoyable, one of the most enjoyable I've had so far. I really enjoyed implementing all of the heuristics I chose and tuning the parameters (using Taguchi Orthogonal Arrays) to get perfect results from the test cases we were given.<br><br>For this coursework I got a grade of 90% which I am very pleased with.
