main | <a href="https://github.com/EricLindesay/dreamKeeper" target="_blank">Repository Link</a><br><br>This is an Android app I developed for myself which I use to record my dreams, storing them in a local Room database. This was developed in Android Studio and was my first attempt at an Android app which I think went pretty well.
motivation | I have very vivid dreams and they are interesting so I like to write them down. To do this I was using a note taking app but it didn't have all the functionality I wanted, I wanted better tagging and searching for tags and dates as well as an easy way to add a new dream. So I created this app.
description | This app allows you to write new dreams and search on dreams you have already written. You can search by date range (e.g. from 01/05/2023 - 31/05/2023, by text in the dream and by tag). Additionally, you can copy the content of a dream after writing it, allowing for easy copy and paste to other locations (I use it to share my dreams with my friends).<br><br>A feature which it was very important for me to include was a home screen widget (shown in the picture at the top). I wanted this widget to make access to the app faster and so that I can look at the dreams through the home screen, without having to open the app fully, and to quickly press the '+' icon to add a new dream through the widget.
result | I use the app every time I have a dream and it is very simple to use. The app isn't currently uploaded to the app store however I may consider uploading it in the future. If I were to upload it to the app store, I would probably add more features to the app such as allowing custom ordering for dreams (right now it sorted by date) and a way to allow the user to export and import dreams. I have not added these features yet as the app is just for my own use and I know I would not use those features.
