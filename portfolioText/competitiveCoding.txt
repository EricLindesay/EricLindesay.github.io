main | <a href="https://github.com/EricLindesay/competitive-coding" target="_blank">Repository Link</a><br><br>I enjoy doing competitive coding problems. They are difficult but very enjoyable, especially when you complete the problem. I use a variety of websites, such as <a href="https://www.codeforces.com" target="_blank">codeforces</a>, <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">leetcode</a>, <a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">codewars</a> and <a href="https://open.kattis.com/" target="_blank">kattis</a>. The reason for the variety in websites is that I have found certain websites train certain skills. Codeforces tends to have more mathematical problems, kattis has more competition problems and leetcode has more interview questions.
motivation | The reason I do these challenges is because of how much fun I have doing them. I enjoy solving the problems and then optimising my answer so that it passes the harsh time limited test cases. Another reason is that I wanted to learn C++ and these problems have taught me a lot, especially with what data structures to use when.
description | These problems all vary massively, some of them are mathematical, others use dynamic programming and others use graph theory. The different websites have different ways of scoring difficulty, however for most problems (excluding some problems for a long time ago) there is a README which describes the problem and my thought process towards the solution. Most of these problems are solved in C++ however some of them use other languages such as Python where it is more appropriate.
result | So far, most competitive coding problems I have completed are documented within the GitHub repo linked above, showing the problem as well as my thought process behind my solutions.
