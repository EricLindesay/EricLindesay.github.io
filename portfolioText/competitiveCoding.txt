main | <a href="https://github.com/EricLindesay/competitive-coding" target="_blank">Repository Link</a><br><br>I enjoy doing competitive coding problems. They are difficult but very enjoyable, especially when you complete the problem. The main website I use for this is <a href="https://www.codeforces.com" target="_blank">codeforces</a> however I sometimes do challenges from other websites such as <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">leetcode</a>, <a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">codewars</a> and <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank">hackerrank</a>.
motivation | The reason I do these challenges is because of how much fun I have doing them. I enjoy solving the problems and then optimising my answer so that it passes the harsh time limited test cases. Another reason is that I wanted to learn C++ and these problems have taught me a lot, especially with what data structures to use when.
description | These problems all vary massively, some of them are mathematical, others use dynamic programming and others use graph theory. Codeforces ranks the questions based on a difficulty with increments of 100. My attempts are sorted in the directories based on this difficulty and have a README which describes the problem and my thought process towards the solution. Most of these problems are solved in C++ however some of them use other languages such as Python.
result | So far, all codeforces problems I have completed are documented within the GitHub repo linked above, showing the problem as well as my thought process behind my solution.
