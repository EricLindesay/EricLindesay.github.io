                    <b>Motivation</b>
                    <br>
                    The university assigned us this project for my second year group project which took the entire year. This was developed for Dr. Xin Chen who was our supervisor. This software is useful for clinicians when they want to segment an image, for example quickly separate a certain group of cells or an organ from the rest of the image. The output from this program could also be used to train an AI model which would allow for automatic segmentation.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Description</b>
                    <br>
                    This project built on a previous program developed by the supervisor available within <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169260721006088" target="_blank">this paper</a> and our task was to convert it to another language to make it faster as well as modernising the GUI. To develop the GUI we used Qt in C++ (which also allowed us to create an installer) and for the segmentation we used OpenCV as well as a pre-provided library. To load the medical image formats (NIfTI and DICOM) and to save the images as NIfTI, we used VTK.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Result</b>
                    <br>
                    For this project, I received <p class="text-danger">TBC%</p>. <a href="https://youtu.be/STxGjxNRmA8" target="_blank">This 2D demo</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/VtxBrwWJ4DM" target="_blank">this 3D demo</a> show the program working for both 2D and 3D segmentations.

They are difficult but very enjoyable, especially when you complete the problem. The main website I use for this is <a href="https://www.codeforces.com" target="_blank">codeforces</a> however I sometimes do challenges from other websites such as <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">leetcode</a>, <a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">codewars</a> and <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank">hackerrank</a>.

                    <b>Motivation</b>
                    <br>
                    The reason I do these challenges is because of how much fun I have doing them. I enjoy solving the problems and then optimising my answer so that it passes the harsh time limited test cases. Another reason is that I wanted to learn C++ and these problems have taught me a lot, especially with what data structures to use when.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Description</b>
                    <br>
                    These problems all very massively, some of them are mathematical, others use dynamic programming and others use graph theory. Codeforces ranks questions based on a difficulty which increments by 100. My attempts are sorted in the directories based on this difficulty and have a README which describes the problem and my thought process towards the solution. Most of these problems are solved in C++ however some of them use other languages such as Python.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Result</b>
                    <br>
                    So far, all codeforces problems I have completed are documented within the GitHub repo linked above, showing the problem as well as my thought process behind my solution.
