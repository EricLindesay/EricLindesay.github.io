                                    This software allows users to segment medical images. This is very useful for
                                    clinicians,
                                    especially with tumour and organ monitoring. If a clinician suspects you may
                                    have a
                                    tumour,
                                    they can get the result of a CT scan and then use this software to segment the
                                    image and
                                    then,
                                    a month later, they can get another scan, segment the image again and then
                                    compare the
                                    two results
                                    and give an informed diagnosis to the patient.

                                    The university assigned us this project for my second year group project. This was
                                    developed for Dr.
                                    Xin Chen who was our supervisor. This software is useful for clinicians when they
                                    want to segment an
                                    image, for example quickly separate a certain group of cells or an organ from the
                                    rest of the image.
                                    The output from this program could also be used to train an AI model which would
                                    allow for automatic
                                    segmentation.

                                    This project built on a previous program developed by the supervisor <linked here>
                                        and our task was
                                        to convert it to another language to make it faster as well as modernising the
                                        GUI. To develop
                                        the GUI we used Qt in C++ and for the segmentation we used OpenCV as well as a
                                        pre-provided
                                        library. To load the medical image formats (NIfTI and DICOM) and to save the
                                        images as NIfTI, we
                                        used VTK.
