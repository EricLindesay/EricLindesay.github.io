                                This was a group project under the supervision of the University in my second year.
                                For this project, I was the Team Leader so I allocated work across the 7 team members
                                and made sure people
                                were doing work to a high quality, as well as writing reports and participating in
                                presentations.

                                I contributed to the code by being the main developer of the front-end which uses the Qt

                                        This software allows users to segment medical images. This is very useful for
                                        clinicians,
                                        especially with tumour and organ monitoring. If a clinician suspects you may
                                        have a
                                        tumour,
                                        they can get the result of a CT scan and then use this software to segment the
                                        image and
                                        then,
                                        a month later, they can get another scan, segment the image again and then
                                        compare the
                                        two results
                                        and give an informed diagnosis to the patient.
